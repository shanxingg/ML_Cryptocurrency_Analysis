# **Cryptocurrency Analysis and Prediction**

There are several paths one can take when deciding in which cryptocurrencies to invest, but a handful of these have risen to the top as the most popular options for investment, they are:

1. Bitcoin (BTC)
2. Ethereum (ETH)
3. Litecoin (LTC)
4. Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
5. Ripple (XRP)
6. Monero (XMR)
7. Zcash (ZEC)

Will BitCoin become ecnomic bubble?<br>

In this analysis report, I performed exploratory data analysis to explore the cryptocurrency market. I also used machine learning algorithms to predict 30-days price of the most popular cryptocurrencies given their historical variations.<br>
